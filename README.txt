 Link - Opera Link Java Web application demo
=====================================================

This is a simple sample java web application that will retrieve
a user's SpeedDials and show them as a web page.

The instructions below assume that you are familiar with working
in a J2EE environment that used Apache Tomcat and Maven, on an
Ubuntu (or Debian) Linux machine.

Compilation dependencies
========================
This project depends on the Opera Link client library found here.
http://github.com/operasoftware/JavaOperaLinkClient

Instructions
============

To build the webapp you need a working Maven installation. 

A quick-start guide for Ubuntu would be:
$> sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
$> sudo apt-get install maven
$> sudo apt-get install tomcat6

Grab the source code for this example

$> cd ~ 
$> git clone git://github.com/operasoftware/JavaOperaLink/

Grab the opera link Java client and build it
$> cd ~ 
$> git clone git://github.com/operasoftware/JavaOperaLinkClient
$> cd JavaOperaLink
$> mvn install

This will result in a the opera-link-client.jar file being deployed
into the .m2 folder on your local machine

Configure the webapp OAuth details in the opera.properties file:
You can use the default key and secret.
opera.consumerKey: SlKQfV4W3huPftrFxPbAHmvCJTZ04sIr
opera.consumerSecret: gFgcy8USFfI3LV8qF3e96bTyYqz4LRqS

And set the callback URL to match the server that you will deploy the example
on. In this case, the local machine.
opera.callbackUrl: http://127.0.0.1/Link/LinkServlet/

Alternativley, go to https://auth.opera.com/service/oauth and register
your own application and use your own key and secret and callback url
of your liking.

Build the web application
$> cd ~/JavaOperaLink
$> mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true (there are no tests)

Much downloading and grinding will happen.
A file called Link.war should be produced in the "target" folder.

Deploy to tomcat and start tomcat
$> cp target/Link.war /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
$> sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

Visit
http://127.0.0.1:8080/Link
Profit $

Known issues
============
Works out of the box on Ubuntu 10.10. If you are running an older version,
you may need to edit the policies in /etc/tomcat6/policy.d to enable
the application to connect to https://auth.opera.com and 
https://link.api.opera.com
